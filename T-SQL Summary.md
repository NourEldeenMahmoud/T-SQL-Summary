#  A - T-SQL Variables

### 1- Declaring a Variable

Use the `DECLARE` keyword to define a variable:

`DECLARE @VariableName DataType;`


**Example:**

`DECLARE @MyName NVARCHAR(50); DECLARE @Counter INT;`

----
### 1- Assigning a Value to a Variable

#### 1. Using `SET`
Assign a single value directly:
`SET @Counter = 10;`

#### 2. Using `SELECT`
Assign a value from a query result:
`SELECT @Counter = COUNT(*) FROM Students;`


> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Difference between `SET` and `SELECT`:**
> 
> - `SET`: Preferred for assigning a single value. It's more explicit and safer.
>     
> - `SELECT`: Can assign values from a query, and allows multiple assignments at once.  
>     But if the query returns multiple rows:
>     
>     - `SELECT` assigns the last row silently.
>         
>     - `SET` throws an error.
>         

----
### 3- special variables

Special variables in T-SQL are **build in variables or global variables** that start with `@@`.

Examples :
* `@@ERROR` Returns the error number from the last T-SQL statement. Returns `0` if no error.
* `@@ROWCOUNT` Number of rows affected by the last statement (e.g. `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`).
* `@@IDENTITY`  Returns the last identity value inserted in the current session and scope.

----------
### 4- Common Use Cases for Variables

- Temporarily storing query results.
    
- Counters or flags in loops (`WHILE`).
    
- Conditional logic (`IF`, `CASE`, etc.).
    
- Parameter manipulation inside stored procedures or scripts.

-----

-----
## B - Control-of-Flow Structures

### `IF` Statements

#### 1- Syntax

`IF condition BEGIN     -- Statements to run if condition is TRUE END ELSE BEGIN     -- Statements to run if condition is FALSE END`

- Used for conditional logic and branching.
- Keep logic simple for better readability.

---
## üîç Examples

####  Example 1 : Basic IF

```
DECLARE @age INT = 20;

IF @age >= 18
BEGIN
    PRINT 'You are an adult.';
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    PRINT 'You are a minor.';
END
```
---

#### Example 2 : Nested `IF`

```
DECLARE @score INT = 85;

IF @score >= 90
    PRINT 'Grade A';
ELSE
    IF @score >= 80
        PRINT 'Grade B';
    ELSE
        PRINT 'Grade C or lower';

```



---

#### Example 3 :Logical Operators with IF

You can use:

- `AND` / `OR` / `NOT`
- `EXISTS`

**Example with `EXISTS`:**
```
IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Employees WHERE Name = 'John')
BEGIN
    PRINT 'Employee exists.';
END
```

---

#### Example 4 : Error Handling with `IF` + `@@ERROR`

```
DECLARE @ErrorValue INT;

INSERT INTO Employees (Name) VALUES ('Nour Eldeen');

SET @ErrorValue = @@ERROR;

IF @ErrorValue <> 0
BEGIN
    PRINT 'An error occurred with error number: ' + CAST(@ErrorValue AS VARCHAR);
    -- Additional error handling logic
END

```

> ‚úÖ Check `@@ERROR` **immediately** after the statement you want to validate.

-------

------
#  `CASE` Statement in T-SQL

The CASE statement in T-SQL provides a flexible way to perform conditional logic within queries, similar to a switch statement in other programming languages. It can be used in SELECT, UPDATE, ORDER BY, and other clauses to categorize data or apply dynamic modifications.

###  Simple CASE Syntax (Like switch)
```
CASE expression

WHEN value1 THEN result1

WHEN value2 THEN result2

[ELSE default_result]

END
```

- **Description**: Compares an expression against a set of values and returns the corresponding result.
- **Notes**: The ELSE clause is optional; if omitted, NULL is returned for unmatched cases.


---

## üîç Examples

### Example 1: Simple CASE

```
SELECT

DepartmentID,

CASE DepartmentID

WHEN 1 THEN 'HR'

WHEN 2 THEN 'Marketing'

ELSE 'Other'

END AS DepartmentName

FROM Employees;
```

- **Explanation**: Maps DepartmentID values to department names ('HR' for 1, 'Marketing' for 2, 'Other' for all others). The result is aliased as DepartmentName.

### Example 2: CASE in UPDATE Statements (Conditional Data Modification)

```
UPDATE Employees2

SET Salary = CASE

WHEN PerformanceRating > 90 THEN Salary * 1.15

WHEN PerformanceRating BETWEEN 75 AND 90 THEN Salary * 1.10

WHEN PerformanceRating BETWEEN 50 AND 74 THEN Salary * 1.05

ELSE Salary

END;
```

- **Explanation**: Adjusts salaries based on PerformanceRating:
    - Increases by 15% if rating > 90.
    - Increases by 10% if rating is 75-90.
    - Increases by 5% if rating is 50-74.
    - No change otherwise (ELSE Salary).

### Example 3: Nested CASE with Aggregation

```
SELECT
    PerformanceCategory,
    COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees,
    AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary
FROM
    (SELECT
        Name,
        Salary,
        CASE
            WHEN PerformanceRating >= 80 THEN 'High'
            WHEN PerformanceRating >= 60 THEN 'Medium'
            ELSE 'Low'
        END AS PerformanceCategory
    FROM Employees2) AS PerformanceTable
GROUP BY PerformanceCategory;
```
	
- **Explanation**:
    1. **Inner Query**: Creates a derived table PerformanceTable by:
        - Selecting Name and Salary.
        - Using CASE to categorize PerformanceRating into 'High' (‚â•80), 'Medium' (‚â•60), or 'Low' (<60).
    2. **Outer Query**: Groups by PerformanceCategory and calculates:
        - COUNT(*) for the number of employees.
        - AVG(Salary) for the average salary per category.
    3. **Result**: Summarizes employee count and average salary by performance category.

---
##  Use Cases

- **Categorizing Values in SELECT**: Assign labels or groups to data (e.g., performance categories).
- **Conditional Logic Inside Queries**: Apply dynamic transformations based on conditions.
- **Dynamic Sorting with ORDER BY**: Sort results based on conditional logic.
- **Applying Logic in UPDATE/INSERT**: Modify data conditionally (e.g., salary adjustments).

---

-------
## `WHILE` Loops in T-SQL

###  Syntax

```
WHILE condition
BEGIN 
-- Statements to repeat 
END
```


- Loop continues **as long as the condition is TRUE**.
- You can control the loop with `BREAK` and `CONTINUE`.
---

### üîç Example 1 ‚Äì Basic Counter Loop
```
DECLARE @Counter INT = 1;
WHILE @Counter <= 5 
BEGIN

PRINT 'Count: ' + CAST(@Counter AS VARCHAR); 
SET @Counter = @Counter + 1;

END
```

**Explanation:**  
Prints numbers from 1 to 5. Increments the counter each time.
```Output
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```


---

### üîç Example 2 ‚Äì Countdown

```Countdown
DECLARE @Counter INT = 5;

WHILE @Counter >= 0
BEGIN
    PRINT 'Count: ' + CAST(@Counter AS VARCHAR);
    SET @Counter = @Counter - 1;
END
```

**Explanation:**  
Counts down from 5 to 0. Decreases the value each loop.

---

### üîç Example 3 ‚Äì Loop with `IF` and `BREAK`

```
DECLARE @Balance DECIMAL(10,2) = 950;
DECLARE @Withdraw DECIMAL(10,2) = 100;

WHILE @Balance > 0
BEGIN
    IF @Balance >= @Withdraw
    BEGIN
        SET @Balance = @Balance - @Withdraw;
        PRINT 'Balance: ' + CAST(@Balance AS VARCHAR);
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'Insufficient funds';
        BREAK;
    END
END
```

**Explanation:**  
Simulates a withdrawal process. If balance is too low, prints a warning and exits using `BREAK`.

---

### üîç Example 4 ‚Äì Iterating Over Table Rows (Manually)

``` Iterating Over Table Rows (Manually)
DECLARE @EmployeeID INT;
DECLARE @EmployeeName NVARCHAR(50);
DECLARE @MaxID INT;

SELECT @EmployeeID = MIN(EmployeeID) FROM Employees;
SELECT @MaxID = MAX(EmployeeID) FROM Employees;

WHILE @EmployeeID IS NOT NULL AND @EmployeeID <= @MaxID
BEGIN
    SELECT @EmployeeName = Name FROM Employees
     WHERE EmployeeID = @EmployeeID;
     
    PRINT @EmployeeName;
    
    SELECT @EmployeeID = MIN(EmployeeID) FROM Employees
     WHERE EmployeeID > @EmployeeID;
END
```

 **Explanation:**  
Prints each employee‚Äôs name by looping through their IDs manually. Useful when you want to simulate row-by-row processing.

---

### Common Use Cases for `WHILE`

|Use Case|Description|
|---|---|
|Basic counters|Loop through numbers / iterations|
|Data processing|Iterate through table rows manually|
|Conditional termination|Exit loop when a condition is no longer valid|
|Simulations or calculations|Perform repeated operations like totals, etc.|
|Nested loops|Build matrices or complex reports|

---

### ‚ö† Notes & Tips

- T-SQL **does not** support `FOR` or `DO...WHILE` loops ‚Äî only `WHILE`.
- Use `BREAK` to **exit the loop early**.
- Use `CONTINUE` to **skip to the next iteration**.
- Loops can become **slow** with large datasets ‚Äî prefer **set-based operations** when possible.

---

---
##  Transactions in T-SQL

### What is a Transaction?

A **transaction** is a group of one or more SQL operations that are executed together as a **single unit**.  
It ensures that **either all operations succeed or none do** ‚Äî this maintains **data integrity**.

---

###  Syntax

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- SQL operations here...

IF @@ERROR <> 0
    ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
ELSE
    COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```
`BEGIN TRANSACTION;  -- SQL operations here...  IF @@ERROR <> 0     ROLLBACK TRANSACTION; ELSE     COMMIT TRANSACTION;`

---

### Example ‚Äì Simple Transfer

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Deduct from sender
UPDATE Accounts
SET Balance = Balance - 500
WHERE AccountID = 1;

-- Add to receiver
UPDATE Accounts
SET Balance = Balance + 500
WHERE AccountID = 2;

-- Error check
IF @@ERROR <> 0
    ROLLBACK;
ELSE
    COMMIT;

```

üìù **Explanation:**
- Ensures both updates succeed together.
- If one fails, changes are rolled back.

---

###  ACID Properties

|Property|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Atomicity|All operations succeed or none do.|
|Consistency|Database stays valid before & after.|
|Isolation|Transactions don't interfere with each other.|
|Durability|Once committed, changes survive system failures.|

---

### üìå Use Cases

- Bank transfers
- Inventory updates
- Order processing
- Logging operations
---

### ‚ö† Tips

- Always handle errors (`@@ERROR` or `TRY...CATCH`).
- You can nest transactions, but only the **outermost** one commits.
- Use `ROLLBACK` to undo, `COMMIT` to finalize.

---

---
##  Stored Procedures in T-SQL

### üîπ What is a Stored Procedure?

A **Stored Procedure (SP)** is a saved block of T-SQL code that can be executed on demand.  
It acts like a **method/function in programming**, used to encapsulate logic, automate tasks, and manage data access securely and efficiently.

---

###  Benefits of Stored Procedures

-  **Performance**: Precompiled and cached by SQL Server.
-  **Security**: Restricts direct table access.
-  **Reusability**: Use the same logic in multiple places.
-  **Maintainability**: Centralizes business logic.
-  **Reduces network traffic**: Only the call is sent, not the whole SQL query.

---

### Syntax

```
CREATE PROCEDURE ProcedureName
    @Param1 DataType,
    @Param2 DataType = DefaultValue
AS
BEGIN
    -- T-SQL statements
END
```


üîπ **Execution:**
```
EXEC ProcedureName @Param1 = value1, @Param2 = value2;
```


---

###  Example 1 -Insert with Validation

**üîπ Use Case:** Ensure that data is valid (e.g., no duplicates) before inserting it into the database.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE AddCustomer
    @Name NVARCHAR(50),
    @Email NVARCHAR(100)
AS
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Customers WHERE Email = @Email)
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'Email already exists.';
        RETURN;
    END

    INSERT INTO Customers (Name, Email) VALUES (@Name, @Email);
END

```

**üß† Explanation:**  
This procedure checks if the email already exists before inserting a new customer. It helps avoid duplicate entries and enforces business rules.

---
### Examples 2 - Filtered Data Retrieval

**üîπ Use Case:** Return specific records based on user input, such as generating reports or loading filtered data in apps.
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetOrdersByCustomer
    @CustomerID INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID;
END

```

**üß† Explanation:**  
This procedure takes a customer ID and returns all related orders. It‚Äôs commonly used in reporting tools or web applications.

---
##  Example 3 ‚Äì Using Output Parameters in a Stored Procedure

 **üîπ Use Case**: Return the total number of orders for a specific customer.

```
CREATE PROCEDURE GetOrderCount
    @CustomerID INT,
    @TotalOrders INT OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT @TotalOrders = COUNT(*)
    FROM Orders
    WHERE CustomerID = @CustomerID;
END
```

---
### Examples 4 - Transactional Operation

**üîπ Use Case:** Execute multiple related operations as one atomic unit ‚Äî either all succeed or none.
```
CREATE PROCEDURE TransferFunds
    @FromID INT,
    @ToID INT,
    @Amount DECIMAL(10,2)
AS
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;

    UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - @Amount WHERE AccountID = @FromID;
    UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + @Amount WHERE AccountID = @ToID;

    COMMIT;
END

```

**üß† Explanation:**  
This procedure performs a money transfer between two accounts. Using a transaction ensures that both updates happen together ‚Äî or not at all.

---
### Examples 5 - Error Handling with TRY...CATCH

**üîπ Use Case:** Catch and handle SQL errors inside procedures instead of crashing or returning bad results.
```
CREATE PROCEDURE SafeDelete
    @ProductID INT
AS
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRY
        DELETE FROM Products WHERE ProductID = @ProductID;
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        PRINT 'Error: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
    END CATCH
END

```
    

---
### Key Features You Can Use Inside SP

- `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- Input / Output parameters
- `IF...ELSE`, `WHILE`, `TRY...CATCH`
- `BEGIN TRANSACTION / COMMIT / ROLLBACK`
- `sp_executesql` for **dynamic SQL**
- **Temporary tables** and **table variables**
- Nested procedure calls
- **SCOPE_IDENTITY()** for returning last inserted ID
---
## Functions
## Functions in T-SQL
### üîπ 1. Scalar Functions

####  What They Are:

- Return **a single scalar value** (e.g., int, string).
- Used **in SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY**, etc.
- **Read-only** (can't perform INSERT/UPDATE).

#### üß™ Example 1 - Average Grade by Subject

```
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.GetAverageGrade(@Subject NVARCHAR(50))
RETURNS INT
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @avg INT;
    SELECT @avg = AVG(Grade) FROM Students WHERE Subject = @Subject;
    RETURN @avg;
END;

```
#### Usage:

`SELECT Name, dbo.GetAverageGrade(Subject) AS AvgGrade FROM Teachers;`

---

### üîπ 2. Inline Table-Valued Functions (ITVF)

#### ‚úÖ What They Are:

- Return a **table** from a **single SELECT statement**.
- Can be used in `FROM`, `JOIN`, subqueries, etc.
- Also **read-only**.

#### Example 2 - Get Students by Subject

```
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.GetStudentsBySubject(@Subject NVARCHAR(50))
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN (
    SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Subject = @Subject
);

```
#### Usage:

`SELECT * FROM dbo.GetStudentsBySubject('Math');`

---

### üîπ 3. Multi-Statement Table-Valued Functions (MTVF)

#### ‚úÖ What They Are:

- Return a table like ITVFs, but with **multiple steps or statements**.
    
- Can define the table structure with `@Result TABLE`.
    
- Still **read-only**.
    

#### Example: Get Top 3 Students

```
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.GetTopPerformingStudents()
RETURNS @Result TABLE (
    StudentID INT,
    Name NVARCHAR(50),
    Subject NVARCHAR(50),
    Grade INT
)
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO @Result
    SELECT TOP 3 StudentID, Name, Subject, Grade
    FROM Students
    ORDER BY Grade DESC;
    RETURN;
END;

```
#### Usage:

`SELECT * FROM dbo.GetTopPerformingStudents();`


---

### üìä Comparison: Functions vs Stored Procedures

| Feature                         | Scalar Function | ITVF  | MTVF  | Stored Procedure         |     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- | ----- | ----- | ------------------------ | --- |
| Returns                         | Single value    | Table | Table | Any (none, scalar, sets) |     |
| Used in SELECT/WHERE            | ‚úÖ Yes           | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No (must EXEC)         |     |
| Can be called inside a query    | ‚úÖ               | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ     | ‚ùå                        |     |
| Supports multiple statements    | ‚ùå               | ‚ùå     | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ                        |     |
| Can modify data (INSERT/UPDATE) | ‚ùå               | ‚ùå     | ‚ùå     | ‚úÖ                        |     |

---

### ‚úÖ When to Use What?

- **Use Scalar Function**: For returning calculated values like grades, bonuses, etc.
    
- **Use ITVF**: When returning filtered or joined datasets via a single `SELECT`.
    
- **Use MTVF**: When logic needs **multiple steps** but should return a table.
    
- **Use Stored Procedure**: When logic includes **data manipulation**, **transactions**, or **complex control flow**.

----
##  T-SQL Ranking Functions ‚Äì Explained with Example

### üß† What are Ranking Functions?

Ranking functions assign a number to each row based on the specified order.  
They are used with `OVER (ORDER BY ...)`, and sometimes `PARTITION BY` to reset ranks in groups.

---

## üìä Example Table: Employees

| EmployeeID | Name    | Department | Salary |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------ |
| 1          | Alice   | HR         | 5000   |
| 2          | Bob     | IT         | 7000   |
| 3          | Charlie | IT         | 7000   |
| 4          | Diana   | HR         | 4500   |
| 5          | Ethan   | IT         | 4000   |

---

## üîé Query Using All 4 Ranking Functions:

```
SELECT Name, Salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS RowNum,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS RankNum,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS DenseRank,
       NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Tile
FROM Employees;

```

---

## üìà Output Explained:

|Name|Salary|RowNum|RankNum|DenseRank|Tile|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Bob|7000|1|1|1|1|
|Charlie|7000|2|1|1|1|
|Alice|5000|3|3|2|2|
|Diana|4500|4|4|3|2|
|Ethan|4000|5|5|4|3|

---

### üìå Explanation:

#### üîπ `ROW_NUMBER()`

- Always gives a unique number (1, 2, 3, ...).
- No matter if values repeat.

#### üîπ `RANK()`

- Same values share the **same rank**.
- Next rank is **skipped** (gaps happen).
	 -  Here: Bob & Charlie get **1**, then Alice gets **3**.

#### üîπ `DENSE_RANK()`

- Same as `RANK()` but **no gaps**.

	- Bob & Charlie get **1**, Alice gets **2**, Diana gets **3**.

#### üîπ `NTILE(n)`

- Divides rows into **n groups** (3 in this case).
- Tries to make them as even as possible.
	- 5 rows ‚Üí groups of 2, 2, 1.

---

## üí° Notes:

- Use `PARTITION BY` if you want to restart the ranks per group (e.g., per department).
    
- `ROW_NUMBER()` is great for pagination.
    
- `NTILE()` is ideal for **quartiles**, **deciles**, or dividing users by score groups.
    
- `RANK()`/`DENSE_RANK()` useful in competitions or ordering by performance.

# Triggers in T-SQL

## What are Triggers?
Triggers in T-SQL are special stored procedures automatically executed in response to specific database events, such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations. They are defined at the table or view level and consist of three key components: **Trigger Event**, **Trigger Condition**, and **Trigger Action**.

-----
## Types of Triggers

 1. **After Triggers**: Execute after the triggering event (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) completes. Used for auditing, logging, or updating related data.
2. **Instead Of Triggers**: Execute instead of the triggering event, overriding the default action. Useful for custom logic, view updates, or soft deletes.

---
## Special Tables

- **inserted**: Contains new or updated rows during INSERT or UPDATE.
- **deleted**: Contains old rows during UPDATE or DELETE.
- 
---
### Example 1 - Auditing New Records (AFTER INSERT)

**üîπ Use Case:** Log every new student added to the `Students` table for auditing purposes.
```
CREATE TRIGGER trg_AuditInsert ON Students
AFTER INSERT
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO StudentLog (StudentID, Name)
    SELECT StudentID, Name FROM inserted;
END;
```

**üß† Explanation:**  
Whenever a new row is inserted into `Students`, the trigger inserts a copy into `StudentLog`.  
This helps track who was added and when ‚Äî useful for security or audit trails.

----
### Example 2 - Soft Deletes (INSTEAD OF DELETE)

**üîπ Use Case:** Instead of deleting records, mark them as inactive by updating a column.

```
ALTER TABLE Students ADD IsActive BIT DEFAULT 1;

CREATE TRIGGER trg_SoftDelete ON Students
INSTEAD OF DELETE
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE Students
    SET IsActive = 0
    FROM deleted
    WHERE Students.StudentID = deleted.StudentID;
END;

```

**üß† Explanation:**  
This prevents actual deletion of data. Instead, it sets `IsActive = 0`, keeping the row in the table.  
Great for historical data tracking and compliance.

---
### Example 3 - Updating a View (INSTEAD OF UPDATE)

**üîπ Use Case:** Make a view that combines multiple tables editable by intercepting update actions.

```
CREATE TRIGGER trg_UpdateStudentView ON StudentView
INSTEAD OF UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE PersonalInfo
    SET Name = I.Name
    FROM inserted I
    WHERE PersonalInfo.StudentID = I.StudentID;

    UPDATE AcademicInfo
    SET Grade = I.Grade
    FROM inserted I
    WHERE AcademicInfo.StudentID = I.StudentID;
END;
```

 **üß† Explanation:**  
Standard UPDATE statements on complex views don‚Äôt work directly.  
This `INSTEAD OF` trigger allows controlled updates to the underlying base tables of the view.

## Notes

- **Performance**: Triggers can impact performance; use judiciously and test thoroughly.
- **Complexity**: Avoid overly complex logic; prefer set-based operations.
- **Maintenance**: Monitor and document triggers to avoid unintended side effects.

----
## Cursors in T-SQL
### What is a Cursor?

A **cursor** is a database object that allows **row-by-row processing** of a result set.

> Unlike a normal `SELECT` which handles **sets**, a cursor lets you **loop** through rows **one at a time**.

---

### When to Use Cursors?

- When you need to apply **complex logic per row**.
- If row-by-row processing is **unavoidable**.
- For **migrating**, **logging**, or **transforming** data row-wise.
‚ö† Prefer **set-based operations** when possible ‚Äì cursors are **slower**.

### Syntax :

```sql
-- 1. Declare the cursor
DECLARE my_cursor CURSOR FOR
SELECT Name, Grade FROM Students;

-- 2. Declare variables to hold each row‚Äôs data
DECLARE @Name NVARCHAR(50), @Grade INT;

-- 3. Open the cursor
OPEN my_cursor;

-- 4. Fetch the first row
FETCH NEXT FROM my_cursor INTO @Name, @Grade;

-- 5. Loop through the result set
WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    PRINT 'Student: ' + @Name + ' - Grade: ' + CAST(@Grade AS VARCHAR);

    -- Fetch the next row
    FETCH NEXT FROM my_cursor INTO @Name, @Grade;
END

-- 6. Close and deallocate
CLOSE my_cursor;
DEALLOCATE my_cursor;

```

-----
### Example : 

```sql
DECLARE @TeacherID INT, @Name NVARCHAR(50);

DECLARE teacher_cursor CURSOR FOR

SELECT TeacherID, Name FROM Teachers WHERE Subject = 'Math';

OPEN teacher_cursor;

FETCH NEXT FROM teacher_cursor INTO @TeacherID, @Name;

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0

BEGIN

UPDATE Teachers SET Salary = Salary * 1.1 WHERE TeacherID = @TeacherID;

FETCH NEXT FROM teacher_cursor INTO @TeacherID, @Name;

END;

CLOSE teacher_cursor;

DEALLOCATE teacher_cursor;
```

---
### Types of Cursors

1. **Static**: Creates a snapshot of the data; changes in the underlying table are not reflected.
2. **Dynamic**: Reflects real-time changes in the underlying table during cursor operation.
3. **Forward-Only**: Allows sequential access from start to end, optimizing resource use.
4. **Scrollable**: Supports navigation in both directions (e.g., previous, next).

### Notes :

Use cursors **only when absolutely necessary**.  
They are powerful for row-by-row logic but come with performance costs.  
Choose the right cursor type depending on:
- The need to scroll.
- Whether the data might change during iteration.
- Whether you need to update rows.

## Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in T-SQL

### Introduction

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in T-SQL are temporary result sets defined within the scope of a single SQL statement. Introduced to enhance query readability and modularity, CTEs allow you to break down complex queries into simpler, reusable parts. They are particularly useful for recursive operations, hierarchical data processing, and improving query structure without creating permanent objects.

### Types of CTEs

1. **Non-Recursive CTEs**: Define a single result set for use in the main query, without recursion.
2. **Recursive CTEs**: Use recursion to process hierarchical or iterative data (e.g., organizational charts, bill of materials).

### Key Characteristics

- **Temporary**: Exists only during the execution of the query that defines it.
- **Readability**: Improves query structure by breaking it into logical blocks.
- **Usage**: Defined with the WITH clause and can be referenced multiple times in the query.
